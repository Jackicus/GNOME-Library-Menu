description: Show Library running in a nested shell, mirrored live on the desktop, and describe what it looks like
argument-hint: "[optional: what to click through first, e.g. 'open a show' or 'the Films tab']"

Show what Library currently looks like, following the `gnome-ext:nested-shell`
skill and this repository's `drive-extension` skill (where things are, and what is
never pressed). The user is watching the mirror window, so `say` before each step.

Requested: $ARGUMENTS

1. `./scripts/nested.sh start --stand-in`: settings of its own and the made-up
   library, nothing of the user's. A running shell is reused: check
   `./scripts/nested.sh status` says `data: stand-in`, and `stop` first if not. A plain `start` only when what is asked is the look beside the user's other
   extensions (Dash to Panel, Blur my Shell), enabled in its own settings as the
   `drive-extension` skill says.
2. In **one** `./scripts/nested.sh do …` call, click through to what was requested and
   `shot` into your scratchpad.
3. **Read the PNG** and describe what is actually on screen.
4. `./scripts/nested.sh stop`, even if a step failed. It closes the mirror;
   `./scripts/nested.sh status` then says `not running`.

Never press what the `drive-extension` skill's "Never press" lists, unless the user
asked for exactly that.
